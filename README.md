# Masters-Project
The R code used to generate the networks and the results from the various community detection algorithms used in my master's project.
masters project.rmd consists of code used to generate social networks from a game of Survivor played online. It relies on the dplyr, ggplot2, and igraph packages.
Masters Project Analysis.rmd consists of code used to generate centrality measures, including vertex betweenness, vertex degree, and modularity; and contains ggplot graphs of these. 
It also contains the code used to generate clusters resulting from the different community detection algorithms at every episode in the game.
Masters Project Test Code.rmd consists of test code that I used as a "whiteboard" of sorts to play around and see what kind of code worked to generate all the networks.
